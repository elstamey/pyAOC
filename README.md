Install Python 3.13.1 for Windows.  Be sure to check the box to add the python launcher to the PATH.

Open Command Prompt.  This puts you in your User Directory.  You need to make a directory for your project.  I usually make a Code directory for all my coding projects.  For example, I used these commands:

    > mkdir Code
    > mkdir AdventOfCode

From here on out, you can use the command `py` at the prompt to execute python scripts. Here is an [example program](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#from-a-script) you can test the command to run a hello script.
